Hello!
This is the Crystal splice script, which allows for modes to be inserted into
base of different torsion. The exact specification are presented within the
script itself. However, there are some points which should be noted.

1. This is not a package in the conventional sense, the users will get a
folder with a script and run the script from there. This will change with
newer versions.

2. This script has not really undergone any testing and is still in the beta
testing stage.

3.  If you would like a copy of this script, please speak to me as there are
some finer points which need to be understood before its use.

Hope that makes sense, if not please speak to AJH
