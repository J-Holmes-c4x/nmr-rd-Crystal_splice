Hello! This is the Non_SDF version of this script, basically, it adds a mode at the base of each torsion to a set value. For this script to work you need to type:

“python3.3 argument_passer.py location_of_gyrate_file Torsion_change_list”

In this case the location_of_gyrate_file is the gyrate file of the round you wish to be edited, and the Torsion_change_list is a text document with a list of torsion and angles you want to insert. An example of this is placed in the folder of this script. 

The script can only be run in this folder, but this folder can only be moved to any location

Please note:
Before you use this script make sure that you BACK UP YOUR PROJECT

When running the script make sure that Gyrate manager is CLOSED.

You are using this script an OWN RISK

Any problems please see AJH
