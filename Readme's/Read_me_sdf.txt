Hello! This is the SDF version of this script, basically, it adds a mode at the base of each torsion to a set value. For this script to work you need to type:

“python3.3 argument_passer_SDF.py location_of_gyrate_file ic_file_location crystal_sdf_file”

In this case the gyrate file is the gyrate file of the round you wish to be edited, the ic_file is of the round you with to be edited and the SDF contains the angle you wish to add to the dynamic model. 

The script can only be run in this folder, but this folder can only be moved to any location

Please note:
Before you use this script make sure that you  BACK UP YOUR PROJECT

When running the script make sure that Gyrate manager is CLOSED

Your SDF must BE CORRECLY labelled. Its atom order must be the same as the atom order in gyrate manger.

You are using this script an OWN RISK

Any problems please see AJH
