basic lay out

unimode to bimode 

bimode to trimode

must work with nested modes




key method ideas
1) work with the tree alone
    make all the changes that are need to the tree and then sort out everything
    else
    pro:
        this would move to the goal of an ADT like system, which would solve
        a lots of problems
        
        its would be easer to mange
        
        it would be easer to adatpt to other things 
        
        it would be clear
    cons:
        it would need quite a significat rewrite
        
        it would take quit a bit long as in weeks
        
        althought using a BT would be great, the current implentaion of method
        is not simple there are a collection of problems when working with 
        this system, as Andys code it not a binary tree in the stictest terms
        
2) work with an updating method, as in running the script multiple times
    pros:
        this would be easer to implement, as it build on the current artcheture
        
        its wouldbe quicker
        
    cons:
        its not the most eligent solution
        
        it would produce a lot of script running and such
        
        its not the best solution
        
        
decision:
    Option 2: is the best siution right now, as it builds on the current system
    howevery, it would be possible to work work toward option 1 with the 
    current system. a first start would be to make the object persistent
    so the script does not run in circles
